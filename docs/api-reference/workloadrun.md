`WorkloadRun` is a user-facing simplified API for running ad-hoc distributed workloads without going through the full Certification pipeline.

## Example

```yaml
apiVersion: nvcre.nvidia.com/v1alpha1
kind: WorkloadRun
metadata:
  name: nccl-all-reduce
spec:
  image: nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:26.01-py3
  framework:
    mpi:
      binary: /usr/local/bin/all_reduce_perf_mpi
      args: ["-b", "8", "-e", "32G", "-f", "2", "-n", "100"]
      mpirunPath: /usr/local/mpi/bin/mpirun
  numNodes: 4   # nodes per job group; all eligible nodes are partitioned into 4-node jobs
  gangScheduler:
    schedulerName: kai-scheduler
    queue: high-priority
  target:
    nodeSelector:
      nvidia.com/gpu.present: "true"
  bandwidthMeasurement:
    logProfileRef: nccl-bandwidth
    testType: all_reduce
  goodputMeasurement:
    logProfileRef: megatron-training
```

## Spec fields

<Warning>
The entire `spec` is **immutable** after the WorkloadRun is created (a `self == oldSelf` transition rule on the CRD rejects every update with `spec is immutable after creation`). Once `status.workflowRef` is set the controller only mirrors the existing Workflow and never rebuilds it, so mutable fields would be silently ignored. To run with different inputs, delete the WorkloadRun and create a new one.
</Warning>

_Fields documented so far:_

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `env` | []EnvVar | Optional. Additional environment variables for the workload containers, merged with the auto-detected NCCL/platform defaults; a user-specified value overrides a default with the same name. Set as container-level env on the workload container (for MPI, on both the launcher and worker containers). For MPI, `mpirun` launches ranks on workers through `sshd`, which gives each session a fresh environment, so the ranks may not inherit container env; a variable the ranks must see should be passed as `-x NAME=value` in `spec.framework.mpi.mpiArgs` |
| `gangScheduler` | GangSchedulerSpec | Optional. Opts workload pods into a gang-aware scheduler such as KAI Scheduler. When set, the scheduler name is injected as `schedulerName` into every workload pod template (for MPI, both launcher and worker pods) and the queue is applied as the `kai.scheduler/queue` label on the pod template metadata, so the scheduler holds all pods until the entire gang can be placed |
| `gangScheduler.schedulerName` | string | Required; minimum length 1. Name of the gang-aware scheduler to use (e.g., `kai-scheduler`). Injected as `schedulerName` in each workload pod spec |
| `gangScheduler.queue` | string | Optional. Scheduler queue to submit the workload to; defaults to `default-queue` when unset. When non-empty, must be a valid Kubernetes label value: at most 63 characters, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character, and containing only alphanumerics, hyphens, underscores, or dots (pattern `^$\|^[a-zA-Z0-9]([a-zA-Z0-9._-]*[a-zA-Z0-9])?$`) |
| `priorityClassName` | string | Optional. Set as `priorityClassName` on every workload pod template (for MPI, both launcher and worker pods), so the scheduler orders the workload's pods against other work by that PriorityClass and, where it preempts, preempts them by it. Independent of `gangScheduler`: the default scheduler honours pod priority too. The PriorityClass must exist in the cluster, or the pods are rejected at admission. Must be a DNS subdomain name of at most 253 characters |
| `target.includeUnschedulable` | bool | Optional; defaults to false. Keeps nodes marked unschedulable (cordoned) in the target set instead of dropping them, for testing a node that was taken out of service and must prove itself before it is returned. The node stays cordoned for the whole run. Workload pods then also tolerate the `node.kubernetes.io/unschedulable` taint, and the default node health check, which otherwise records a cordon during the run as a hardware failure, is not applied (a `nodeHealthMonitor` that is exactly that check is dropped for the same reason; any other expression is kept). Without it, cordoned nodes that matched the target are reported as excluded and the run is at best `INCOMPLETE` |

`numNodes` (shown in the example above) is the number of nodes **per job group**, not a total: the orchestrator partitions all eligible nodes into groups of that size.

## Status fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `conditions` | []Condition | Exclusive set: `InProgress`, `Succeeded`, `Failed`. Independent (additive): `ValidationFailed` — mirrored from the Workflow whenever any Job violated a performance threshold. When the threshold miss is the failure cause, `Failed` carries reason `WorkflowValidationFailed` so a threshold miss is distinguishable from an execution failure |
| `workflowRef` | WorkflowReference | Reference to the underlying `Workflow` resource |
| `detectedGPUArchitecture` | string | Auto-detected GPU type (e.g., `h100`, `gb200`) |
| `detectedPlatform` | string | Auto-detected CSP platform (e.g., `aws`, `gcp`, `azure`) |
| `resolvedGpusPerNode` | int32 | Final GPU count per node used for the workload |
| `succeededNodesRef` | TypedLocalObjectReference | ConfigMap reference for the succeeded-nodes list |
| `failedNodesRef` | TypedLocalObjectReference | ConfigMap reference for the failed-nodes list |

Bandwidth and goodput measurement results are on the `BandwidthMeasurement` and `GoodputMeasurement` child resources, which reference this WorkloadRun's underlying Job via `spec.jobRef`.
